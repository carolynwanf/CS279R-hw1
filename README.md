## How to use the prototype
### Locally
1. Download the directory from Github
2. Link your own cluster to the DB_CONNECT env variable (I did not push my env variables for security reasons)
2. Run npm install from your terminal to install the proper node packages
3. Run npm start to start the server
4. Access the prototype at localhost:3000
